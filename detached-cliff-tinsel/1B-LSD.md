## Basic Information

**Summary**

1B-LSD (1-butanoyl-lysergic acid diethylamide) is an LSD analogue which appears to be about as potent as 1P-LSD (slightly more potent than LSD) and has a slightly shorter duration than that of LSD, again thought to be about the same as 1P-LSD. Released in late 2018, and marketed agressively as a replacement for 1P-LSD. 1B-LSD does not yet have a clearly established safety profile,

#### 

 NOTE: At the time of this chemical's release, the manufacturers claimed 1B-LSD was expected to be slightly less potent than 1P-LSD, supposedly owing to the increased mass of the butanoyl group over the propionyl group, however anecdotes seem to indicate approximate equipotency to 1P-LSD.
