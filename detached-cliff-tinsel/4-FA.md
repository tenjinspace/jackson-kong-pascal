## Basic Information

**Summary**

An empathogen commonly used in place of MDMA, having a similar duration of empathogenic effects. This drug, however, has a longer stimulant "tail," during which effects are more like those of amphetamines. Not to be confused with 4-FMA, which has a similar potency, but is not particularly empathogenic.

#### [Stimulant](/category/stimulant)

#### [Common](/category/common)

Common drugs are those which are well known and widely used among the drug community. This doesn't necessarily mean they are safe, but it usually comes with a longer relative history of use in humans with which to establish a safety profile.
