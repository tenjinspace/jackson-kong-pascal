### Caution

* [Cannabis](/cannabis)  
   * Cannabis has an unexpectedly strong and somewhat unpredictable synergy with psychedelics. Small amounts can reduce nausea with aMT but take care.
* [Caffeine](/caffeine)  
   * High doses of caffeine may cause anxiety which is less manageable when tripping, and since both are stimulating the combination may cause some physical discomfort.
* [Alcohol](/alcohol)  
   * aMT has a broad mechanism of action in the brain and so does alcohol so the combination can be unpredictable
