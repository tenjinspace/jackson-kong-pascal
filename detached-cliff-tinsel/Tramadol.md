# Tramadol

tramadol

## Basic Information

**Summary**

A synthetic opioid analgesic, tramadol is used to treat moderate pain and can be considered a medium-strength opioid. Tramadol also has the unusual effect of being a serotonin releasing agent and a serotonin reuptake inhibitor, and as a consequence should not be taken in excess due to the risk of serotonin syndrome. Risk of seizures above 300mg doses.

#### [Opioid](/category/opioid)

Opioids are pain-killing depressants which may also cause euphoria.

#### [Habit-forming](/category/habit-forming)

These drugs pose a higher risk of causing habit forming behaviour, take particular care with the amount and frequency they are taken.

#### [Depressant](/category/depressant)

Depressants are drugs which reduce arousal and stimulation in the user, characterised by a depressing of mental and physical functions.

#### [Common](/category/common)

Common drugs are those which are well known and widely used among the drug community. This doesn't necessarily mean they are safe, but it usually comes with a longer relative history of use in humans with which to establish a safety profile.

**Dose**

| Oral   |           |
| ------ | --------- |
| Light  | 50-100mg  |
| Common | 100-250mg |
| Heavy  | 250-400mg |

#### 

 NOTE: Tramadol has a ceiling dose, where recreational effects are not increased. Risk of seizure at doses over 300mg. Tramadol decreases the seizure threshold, use extreme caution. Dosing insufflated is ineffective.

**Duration**

| All ROAs      |            |
| ------------- | ---------- |
| Onset         | 1 hours    |
| Duration      | 5-7 hours  |
| After-effects | 1-12 hours |

**Effects**

euphoria, elevated mood, overall feeling of contentedness, itching, drowsiness, vomiting, urinary retention, nausea, constipation, risk of seizure above 300mg

**Avoid**

benzos, alcohol, and other opiates

**Bioavailability**

Oral 68-72% | Rectal 77%

**Aliases**

## Interactions

### Dangerous

* [Î±MT](/amt)
* [Ketamine](/ketamine)
* [MXE](/mxe)
* [DXM](/dxm)
* [PCP](/pcp)
* [Amphetamines](https://wiki.tripsit.me/wiki/Amphetamine)  
   * Tramadol and stimulants both increase the risk of seizures.
* [MDMA](/mdma)  
   * Tramadol and stimulants both increase the risk of seizures.
* [Cocaine](/cocaine)  
   * Tramadol and stimulants both increase the risk of seizures.
* [Alcohol](/alcohol)  
   * Heavy CNS depressants, risk of seizures. Both substances potentiate the ataxia and sedation caused by the other and can lead to unexpected loss of consciousness at high doses. Place affected patients in the recovery position to prevent vomit aspiration from excess. Memory blackouts are likely.
* [GHB/GBL](https://wiki.tripsit.me/wiki/GHB)  
   * The sedative effects of this combination can lead to dangerous respiratory depression.
* [Opioids](https://wiki.tripsit.me/wiki/Opioids)  
   * Concomitant use of tramadol increases the seizure risk in patients taking other opioids. These agents are often individually epileptogenic and may have additive effects on seizure threshold during coadministration. Central nervous system- and/or respiratory-depressant effects may be additively or synergistically present
* [Benzodiazepines](https://wiki.tripsit.me/wiki/Benzodiazepines)  
   * Central nervous system- and/or respiratory-depressant effects may be additively or synergistically present. Vomit aspiration a risk when passed out, lay down in recovery position if ingested.
* [MAOIs](https://wiki.tripsit.me/wiki/Antidepressants#MAOIs)
* [SSRIs](https://wiki.tripsit.me/wiki/Antidepressants#SSRIs)

### Caution

* [N2O](/nitrous)  
   * Both substances potentiate the ataxia and sedation caused by the other and can lead to unexpected loss of consciousness at high doses. While unconscious, vomit aspiration is a risk if not placed in the recovery position. Memory blackouts are likely.

### Unsafe

* [Mushrooms](/mushrooms)  
   * Tramadol is well known to lower seizure threshold and psychedelics also cause occasional seizures.
* [LSD](/lsd)  
   * Tramadol is well known to lower seizure threshold and psychedelics also cause occasional seizures.
* [DMT](/dmt)  
   * Tramadol is well known to lower seizure threshold and psychedelics also cause occasional seizures.
* [Mescaline](/mescaline)  
   * This combination can cause seizures due to the lowering of the threshold by tramadol and the potential of mescaline to cause seziures.
* [DOx](https://wiki.tripsit.me/wiki/DOx)  
   * Tramadol is well known to lower seizure threshold and psychedelics also cause occasional seizures.
* [NBOMes](https://wiki.tripsit.me/wiki/NBOMes)  
   * Tramadol is well known to lower seizure threshold and NBOMes have also shown a tendency to cause severe seizures
* [2C-x](https://wiki.tripsit.me/wiki/2C-X)  
   * Tramadol is well known to lower seizure threshold and psychedelics raise the risk of seizures.
