## Basic Information

**Summary**

RC benzodiazepine discovered by Hoffman-LaRoche in the 1970s. Came to the RC market in the early 2010s. At lower doses it is mainly an anxiolytic compound, yet at higher doses can be quite sedating, hypnotic, amnesic, and can cause loss of inhibitions. Structurally similar to Alprazolam, Bromazepam, and Triazolam. Is 12x as potent as Diazepam.

## Interactions

### Dangerous

* [Alcohol](/alcohol)  
   * Ethanol ingestion may potentiate the CNS effects of many benzodiazepines. The two substances potentiate each other strongly and unpredictably, very rapidly leading to unconsciousness. While unconscious, vomit aspiration is a risk if not placed in the recovery position. Blacking out and memory loss is almost certain.
* [GHB/GBL](https://wiki.tripsit.me/wiki/GHB)  
   * The two substances potentiate each other strongly and unpredictably, very rapidly leading to unconsciousness. While unconscious, vomit aspiration is a risk if not placed in the recovery position.
* [Opioids](https://wiki.tripsit.me/wiki/Opioids)  
   * Central nervous system and/or respiratory-depressant effects may be additively or synergistically present. The two substances potentiate each other strongly and unpredictably, very rapidly leading to unconsciousness. While unconscious, vomit aspiration is a risk if not placed in the recovery position Blackouts/memory loss likely
* [Tramadol](/tramadol)  
   * Central nervous system- and/or respiratory-depressant effects may be additively or synergistically present. Vomit aspiration a risk when passed out, lay down in recovery position if ingested.

### Caution

* [Ketamine](/ketamine)  
   * Both substances potentiate the ataxia and sedation caused by the other and can lead to unexpected loss of consciousness at high doses. While unconscious, vomit aspiration is a risk if not placed in the recovery position.
* [MXE](/mxe)  
   * Both substances potentiate the ataxia and sedation caused by the other and can lead to unexpected loss of consciousness at high doses. Place affected patients in the recovery position to prevent vomit aspiration from excess.
* [DXM](/dxm)  
   * Small doses of benzos can end a bad trip, but both substances potentiate the ataxia and sedation caused by the other and this can lead to unexpected loss of consciousness at high doses. While unconscious, vomit aspiration is a risk if not placed in the recovery position.

### Unsafe

* [PCP](/pcp)  
   * Both substances potentiate the ataxia and sedation caused by the other and can lead to unexpected loss of consciousness at high doses. While unconscious, vomit aspiration is a risk if not placed in the recovery position. Memory blackouts are likely
