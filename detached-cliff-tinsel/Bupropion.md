bupropion

## Basic Information

**Summary**

A frequently prescribed atypical antidepressant. Occasionally prescribed as an aid to smoking cessation. May lower seizure threshold in predisposed individuals. Poorly understood mechanism of action, probably an NDRI. Avoid combination with other drugs.

#### [Stimulant](/category/stimulant)

Stimulants excite the nervous system and increase physiological function.

**General-effects**

Mild - moderate increase in motor activity and agitation/excitement

**Adverse-effects**

Agitation, dry mouth, insomnia, headache/migraine, nausea/vomiting, constipation, tremor, dizziness, excessive sweating, blurred vision, tachycardia, confusion, rash, hostility, cardiac arrhythmia, and auditory disturbance

**Overdose-symptoms**

Seizure, hallucinations, loss of consciousness, sinus tachycardia, ECG changes, bradycardia, cardiac failure, cardiac arrest, and death

**Warning**

Bupropion lowers the seizure threshold and can induce seizures when excessive doses are used and/or when combined with CNS stimulants or other drugs that also lower the threshold, such as theophylline, steroids, some tricyclic antidepressants, and alcohol

**Chemistry**

IUPAC: (±)-2-(tert-Butylamino)-1-(3-chlorophenyl)propan-1-one | Formula: C13H18ClNO | Molecular Mass: 239.74 g/mol

**Pharmacology**

NDRI (Norepinephrine-Dopamine Reuptake Inhibitor); NDRA (Norepinephrine-Dopamine Releasing Agent); α3β2, α3β4, α4β2, and α7 nACh receptor antagonist
