**Summary**

An entactogen, stimulant and psychedelic first synthesised by Alexander Shulgin, MDOH is an analogue of MDA. Described as highly psychedelic, it is likely a serotonin releasing agent. It has not seen widespread use, perhaps due to a number of reported negative side effects such as urinary retention and a heavy comedown.
