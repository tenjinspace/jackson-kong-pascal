* [MAOIs](https://wiki.tripsit.me/wiki/Antidepressants#MAOIs)

### Caution

* [Mescaline](/mescaline)  
   * The 5-MeO class of tryptamines can be unpredictable in their interactions
* [DOx](https://wiki.tripsit.me/wiki/DOx)  
   * The 5-MeO class of tryptamines can be unpredictable in their interactions, particularly increasing the risk of unpleasant physical side effects.
* [NBOMes](https://wiki.tripsit.me/wiki/NBOMes)  
   * The 5-MeO class of tryptamines can be unpredictable in their interactions and the NBOMes are known to be unpredictable even alone. This combination is best avoided
* [2C-x](https://wiki.tripsit.me/wiki/2C-X)  
   * The 5-MeO psychedelics can interact unpredictably to potentiate other psychedelics
* [2C-T-x](https://wiki.tripsit.me/wiki/2C-X)  
   * Both classes of compounds can be unpredictable alone
* [Cannabis](/cannabis)  
   * Cannabis has an unexpectedly strong and somewhat unpredictable synergy with psychedelics.
* [MDMA](/mdma)  
   * Some of the 5-MeO tryptamines are a bit unpredictable and should be mixed with MDMA with care

### Unsafe

* [DXM](/dxm)  
   * Little information exists about this combination.
* [Amphetamines](https://wiki.tripsit.me/wiki/Amphetamine)  
   * The anxiogenic and focusing effects of stimulants increase the chance of unpleasant thought loops. The combination is generally unnecessary because of the stimulating effects of psychedelics.
* [Cocaine](/cocaine)  
   * The anxiogenic and focusing effects of stimulants increase the chance of unpleasant thought loops. The combination is generally unnecessary because of the stimulating effects of psychedelics.
