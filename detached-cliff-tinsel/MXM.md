## Basic Information

**Summary**

An arylcyclohexamine, dissociative and anaesthetic closely related to methoxetamine, ketamine and PCP. It has seen some popularity among RC users, being advertised as an MXE replacement after its illegalisation in many parts of the world - however, users report a more stimulating experience closer to those caused by PCP and its analogues.

#### [Dissociative](/category/dissociative)

Dissociatives are mostly NMDA receptor antagonists, these substances are hallucinogenic but different than psychedelics. As per the name, these substances create a distance between the user and reality.
