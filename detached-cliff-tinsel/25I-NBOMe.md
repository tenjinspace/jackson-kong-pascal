## Basic Information

**Summary**

A relatively new and popular research chemical with psychedelic properties. Users report an uncomfortable body load with very strong visuals, though with less of a mental aspect than most psychedelics. Commonly mis-sold as LSD, since it is much cheaper to produce. Is considered quite unsafe, and has caused several deaths at 'regular' doses.
