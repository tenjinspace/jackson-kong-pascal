## Basic Information

**Summary**

A relatively rare dissociative anesthetic, pharmacologically classified as an NMDA receptor antagonist. It is related to other anesthetics in this family such as Ketamine and phencyclidine. Has been used to cut Ketamine, in which case it may cause additional nausea. In Veterinary practice it is mixed with Zolazolam, a potent anaesthetic at a 1:1 ratio.
