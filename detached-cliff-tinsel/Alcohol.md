## Basic Information

**Summary**

Alcohol is a CNS depressant that acts through the GABAₐ receptor, and is one of the most common strong psychoactives used by humans. It has a long history of use and its intoxicating effects are well-studied and documented. It remains legal in most parts of the world.

#### [Depressant](/category/depressant)

Depressants are drugs which reduce arousal and stimulation in the user, characterised by a depressing of mental and physical functions.

#### [Habit-forming](/category/habit-forming)

These drugs pose a higher risk of causing habit forming behaviour, take particular care with the amount and frequency they are taken.

#### [Common](/category/common)

Common drugs are those which are well known and widely used among the drug community. This doesn't necessarily mean they are safe, but it usually comes with a longer relative history of use in humans with which to establish a safety profile.

## Interactions

### Dangerous

* [Ketamine](/ketamine)  
   * Both substances cause ataxia and bring a very high risk of vomiting and unconsciousness. If the user falls unconscious while under the influence there is a severe risk of vomit aspiration if they are not placed in the recovery position.
* [MXE](/mxe)  
   * There is a high risk of memory loss, vomiting and severe ataxia from this combination.
* [DXM](/dxm)  
   * Both substances potentiate the ataxia and sedation caused by the other and can lead to unexpected loss of consciousness at high doses. Place affected patients in the recovery position to prevent vomit aspiration from excess. Additionally CNS depression can lead to difficulty breathing. Avoid on anything higher than 1st plateau.
* [GHB/GBL](https://wiki.tripsit.me/wiki/GHB)  
   * Even in very low doses this combination rapidly leads to memory loss, severe ataxia and unconsciousness. There is a high risk of vomit aspiration while unconscious.
* [Opioids](https://wiki.tripsit.me/wiki/Opioids)  
   * Both substances potentiate the ataxia and sedation caused by the other and can lead to unexpected loss of consciousness at high doses. Place affected patients in the recovery position to prevent vomit aspiration from excess. Memory blackouts are likely
* [Tramadol](/tramadol)  
   * Heavy CNS depressants, risk of seizures. Both substances potentiate the ataxia and sedation caused by the other and can lead to unexpected loss of consciousness at high doses. Place affected patients in the recovery position to prevent vomit aspiration from excess. Memory blackouts are likely.
* [Benzodiazepines](https://wiki.tripsit.me/wiki/Benzodiazepines)  
   * Ethanol ingestion may potentiate the CNS effects of many benzodiazepines. The two substances potentiate each other strongly and unpredictably, very rapidly leading to unconsciousness. While unconscious, vomit aspiration is a risk if not placed in the recovery position. Blacking out and memory loss is almost certain.

### Caution

* [αMT](/amt)  
   * aMT has a broad mechanism of action in the brain and so does alcohol so the combination can be unpredictable
* [N2O](/nitrous)  
   * Both substances potentiate the ataxia and sedation caused by the other and can lead to unexpected loss of consciousness at high doses. While unconscious, vomit aspiration is a risk if not placed in the recovery position. Memory blackouts are likely.
* [Amphetamines](https://wiki.tripsit.me/wiki/Amphetamine)  
   * Drinking on stimulants is risky because the sedative effects of the alcohol are reduced, and these are what the body uses to gauge drunkenness. This typically leads to excessive drinking with greatly reduced inhibitions, high risk of liver damage and increased dehydration. They will also allow you to drink past a point where you might normally pass out, increasing the risk. If you do decide to do this then you should set a limit of how much you will drink each hour and stick to it, bearing in mind that you will feel the alcohol and the stimulant less. Extended release formulations may severely impede sleep, further worsening the hangover.
* [MDMA](/mdma)  
   * Both MDMA and alcohol cause dehydration. Approach this combination with caution, moderation and sufficient hydration. More than a small amount of alcohol will dull the euphoria of MDMA
* [SSRIs](https://wiki.tripsit.me/wiki/Antidepressants#SSRIs)  
   * Alcohol may potentiate some of the pharmacologic effects of CNS-active agents. Use in combination may result in additive central nervous system depression and/or impairment of judgment, thinking, and psychomotor skills.

### Unsafe

* [PCP](/pcp)  
   * Details of this combination are not well understood but PCP generally interacts in an unpredictable manner.
* [Cocaine](/cocaine)  
   * Drinking on stimulants is risky because the sedative effects of the alcohol are reduced, and these are what the body uses to gauge drunkenness. This typically leads to excessive drinking with greatly reduced inhibitions, high risk of liver damage and increased dehydration. They will also allow you to drink past a point where you might normally pass out, increasing the risk. If you do decide to do this then you should set a limit of how much you will drink each hour and stick to it, bearing in mind that you will feel the alcohol less. Cocaine is potentiated somewhat by alcohol because of the formation of cocaethylene.
* [MAOIs](https://wiki.tripsit.me/wiki/Antidepressants#MAOIs)  
   * Tyramine found in many alcoholic beverages can have dangerous reactions with MAOIs, causing an increase in blood pressure.

### Low Risk & Increased Effects

* [Cannabis](/cannabis)  
   * In excess, this combination can cause nausea.

### Low Risk & No Increased Effects

* [Caffeine](/caffeine)

### Low Risk & Decreased Effects

* [Mushrooms](/mushrooms)
* [LSD](/lsd)
* [DMT](/dmt)
* [Mescaline](/mescaline)
* [DOx](https://wiki.tripsit.me/wiki/DOx)  
   * Drinking on stimulants is risky because the sedative effects of the alcohol are reduced, and these are what the body uses to gauge drunkenness. This typically leads to excessive drinking with greatly reduced inhibitions, high risk of liver damage and increased dehydration. They will also allow you to drink past a point where you might normally pass out, increasing the risk.
* [NBOMes](https://wiki.tripsit.me/wiki/NBOMes)
* [2C-x](https://wiki.tripsit.me/wiki/2C-X)
* [2C-T-x](https://wiki.tripsit.me/wiki/2C-X)  
   * Both these classes of compound can interact unpredictably. Caution should be exercised.
* [5-MeO-xxT](https://wiki.tripsit.me/wiki/5-MeO-DMT)

### General

* Alcohol and benzodiazepines in fatal poisonings. - <https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12170103>
* Drinking while pregnant creates and strengthens many risks associated with childbirth. It will also increase the chances of premature labour, which can be incredibly dangerous for both the baby and mother. -
