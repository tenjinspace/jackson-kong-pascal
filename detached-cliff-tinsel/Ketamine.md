# Ketamine

ketamine

## Basic Information

**Summary**

A short acting dissociative anaesthetic and hallucinogen commonly used in emergency medicine. It is the prototypical dissociative, and is widely used at sub-anesthetic doses recreationally. Small doses are comparable with alcohol, while larger doses are immobilising and lead to psychedelic experiences: the "K-Hole."

#### [Dissociative](/category/dissociative)

Dissociatives are mostly NMDA receptor antagonists, these substances are hallucinogenic but different than psychedelics. As per the name, these substances create a distance between the user and reality.

#### [Habit-forming](/category/habit-forming)

These drugs pose a higher risk of causing habit forming behaviour, take particular care with the amount and frequency they are taken.

#### [Common](/category/common)

Common drugs are those which are well known and widely used among the drug community. This doesn't necessarily mean they are safe, but it usually comes with a longer relative history of use in humans with which to establish a safety profile.

**Dose**

| Insufflated |           |
| ----------- | --------- |
| Threshold   | 5-10mg    |
| Light       | 20-50mg   |
| Common      | 50-125mg  |
| Strong      | 125-175mg |
| Heavy       | 175mg+    |

#### 

 NOTE: Ketamine is based on weight. These are figures for the average 150 pound male There is no concrete dose for the "K-Hole" as each user is different.

**Duration**

| Insufflated   |                |
| ------------- | -------------- |
| Onset         | 7.5-20 minutes |
| Duration      | 1-2 hours      |
| After-effects | 1-2 hours      |

| Oral          |               |
| ------------- | ------------- |
| Onset         | 10-75 minutes |
| Duration      | 1-2 hours     |
| After-effects | 1-2 hours     |

| Intramuscular |               |
| ------------- | ------------- |
| Onset         | 2-7.5 minutes |
| Duration      | 1-2 hours     |
| After-effects | 1-2 hours     |

| Intravenous   |             |
| ------------- | ----------- |
| Onset         | 0-2 minutes |
| Duration      | 1-2 hours   |
| After-effects | 1-2 hours   |

**Avoid**

Driving. Moving and walking if possible. Mixing with other depressants like alcohol, benzos and opiates.

**Effects**

A feeling of drunkenness and well being at low doses. As dose increases the user may begin to feel a disconnection from their body. At 'khole' doses the user may become completely disconnected from both body and mind.

## Interactions

### Dangerous

* [Alcohol](/alcohol)  
   * Both substances cause ataxia and bring a very high risk of vomiting and unconsciousness. If the user falls unconscious while under the influence there is a severe risk of vomit aspiration if they are not placed in the recovery position.
* [GHB/GBL](https://wiki.tripsit.me/wiki/GHB)  
   * Both substances cause ataxia and bring a risk of vomiting and unconsciousness. If the user falls unconscious while under the influence there is a severe risk of vomit aspiration if they are not placed in the recovery position.
* [Opioids](https://wiki.tripsit.me/wiki/Opioids)  
   * Both substances bring a risk of vomiting and unconsciousness. If the user falls unconscious while under the influence there is a severe risk of vomit aspiration if they are not placed in the recovery position.
* [Tramadol](/tramadol)

### Caution

* [Amphetamines](https://wiki.tripsit.me/wiki/Amphetamine)  
   * No unexpected interactions, though likely to increase blood pressure but not an issue with sensible doses. Moving around on high doses of this combination may be ill advised due to risk of physical injury.
* [Cocaine](/cocaine)  
   * No unexpected interactions, though likely to increase blood pressure but not an issue with sensible doses. Moving around on high doses of this combination may be ill advised due to risk of physical injury.
* [Benzodiazepines](https://wiki.tripsit.me/wiki/Benzodiazepines)  
   * Both substances potentiate the ataxia and sedation caused by the other and can lead to unexpected loss of consciousness at high doses. While unconscious, vomit aspiration is a risk if not placed in the recovery position.
* [MAOIs](https://wiki.tripsit.me/wiki/Antidepressants#MAOIs)  
   * MAO-B inhibitors appear to increase the potency of Ketamine. MAO-A inhbitors have some negative reports associated with the combination but there isn't much information available
