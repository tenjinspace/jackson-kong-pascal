## Basic Information

Changa is the name given to a smoking blend of caapi or other MAOI containing plants with an infusion of extracted DMT. Changa often contains other milder psychoactive herbs as well. The maoi action results in a longer and more intense trip (see Ayahuasca) NOTE: There is no standardized recipe or concentration of infused DMT, therefor dosage and potency will vary per batch.
