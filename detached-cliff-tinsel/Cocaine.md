# Cocaine

cocaine

## Basic Information

**Summary**

A highly popular, short acting CNS stimulant that works by blocking the reuptake of dopamine, serotonin, and norepinephrine. It is known to increase euphoria, confidence, sex-drive, focus, body temperature, and heart rate. Cocaine can cause severe vasoconstriction and is known to be cardiotoxic and have a high potential for compulsive redosing and addiction.

#### [Stimulant](/category/stimulant)

Stimulants excite the nervous system and increase physiological function.

#### [Habit-forming](/category/habit-forming)

These drugs pose a higher risk of causing habit forming behaviour, take particular care with the amount and frequency they are taken.

#### [Common](/category/common)

Common drugs are those which are well known and widely used among the drug community. This doesn't necessarily mean they are safe, but it usually comes with a longer relative history of use in humans with which to establish a safety profile.

## Interactions

### Dangerous

* [αMT](/amt)
* [Opioids](https://wiki.tripsit.me/wiki/Opioids)  
   * Stimulants increase respiration rate allowing a higher dose of opiates. If the stimulant wears off first then the opiate may overcome the patient and cause respiratory arrest.
* [Tramadol](/tramadol)  
   * Tramadol and stimulants both increase the risk of seizures.
* [MAOIs](https://wiki.tripsit.me/wiki/Antidepressants#MAOIs)  
   * This combination is poorly explored

### Caution

* [Mushrooms](/mushrooms)  
   * Stimulants increase anxiety levels and the risk of thought loops which can lead to negative experiences
* [LSD](/lsd)  
   * Stimulants increase anxiety levels and the risk of thought loops which can lead to negative experiences
* [DMT](/dmt)  
   * Stimulants increase anxiety levels and the risk of thought loops which can lead to negative experiences
* [Mescaline](/mescaline)  
   * The focus and anxiety caused by stimulants is magnified by psychedelics and results in an increased risk of thought loops
* [2C-x](https://wiki.tripsit.me/wiki/2C-X)  
   * The anxiogenic and focusing effects of stimulants increase the chance of unpleasant thought loops. The combination is generally unnecessary because of the stimulating effects of psychedelics. Combination of the stimulating effects may be uncomfortable.
* [Cannabis](/cannabis)  
   * Stimulants increase anxiety levels and the risk of thought loops which can lead to negative experiences
* [Ketamine](/ketamine)  
   * No unexpected interactions, though likely to increase blood pressure but not an issue with sensible doses. Moving around on high doses of this combination may be ill advised due to risk of physical injury.
* [MXE](/mxe)  
   * Stimulants taken with MXE can lead to hypermanic states much more easily, especially if sleep is avoided.
* [Amphetamines](https://wiki.tripsit.me/wiki/Amphetamine)  
   * This combination of stimulants will increase strain on the heart. It is not generally worth it as cocaine has a mild blocking effect on dopamine releasers like amphetamine
* [MDMA](/mdma)  
   * Cocaine blocks some of the desirable effects of MDMA while increasing the risk of heart attack.
* [Caffeine](/caffeine)  
   * Both stimulants, risk of tachycardia, hypertension, and in extreme cases heart failure.
* [GHB/GBL](https://wiki.tripsit.me/wiki/GHB)  
   * Stimulants increase respiration rate allowing a higher dose of sedatives. If the stimulant wears off first then the opiate may overcome the patient and cause respiratory arrest. Likewise the G can wear off and leave a dangerous concentration of cocaine behind

### Unsafe

* [DOx](https://wiki.tripsit.me/wiki/DOx)  
   * The combined stimulating effects of the two can lead to an uncomfortable body-load, while the focusing effects of cocaine can easily lead to thought loops. Coming down from cocaine while the DOx is still active can be quite anxiogenic
* [NBOMes](https://wiki.tripsit.me/wiki/NBOMes)  
   * Cocaine and NBOMes both provide considerable stimulation. When combined they can result in severe vasoconstriction, tachycardia, hypertension, and in extreme cases heart failure.
* [2C-T-x](https://wiki.tripsit.me/wiki/2C-X)  
   * Cocaine and 2c-t-x both provide considerable stimulation. When combined they can result in severe vasoconstriction, tachycardia, hypertension, and in extreme cases heart failure.
* [5-MeO-xxT](https://wiki.tripsit.me/wiki/5-MeO-DMT)  
   * The anxiogenic and focusing effects of stimulants increase the chance of unpleasant thought loops. The combination is generally unnecessary because of the stimulating effects of psychedelics.
* [DXM](/dxm)  
   * Both substances raise heart rate, in extreme cases, panic attacks caused by these drugs have led to more serious heart issues
* [PCP](/pcp)  
   * This combination can easily lead to hypermanic states
* [Alcohol](/alcohol)  
   * Drinking on stimulants is risky because the sedative effects of the alcohol are reduced, and these are what the body uses to gauge drunkenness. This typically leads to excessive drinking with greatly reduced inhibitions, high risk of liver damage and increased dehydration. They will also allow you to drink past a point where you might normally pass out, increasing the risk. If you do decide to do this then you should set a limit of how much you will drink each hour and stick to it, bearing in mind that you will feel the alcohol less. Cocaine is potentiated somewhat by alcohol because of the formation of cocaethylene.

### Low Risk & Increased Effects

* [N2O](/nitrous)

### Low Risk & No Increased Effects

* [SSRIs](https://wiki.tripsit.me/wiki/Antidepressants#SSRIs)  
   * May reduce each others' effectiveness. Cocaine can reduce mental stability and therefore exacerbate conditions which SSRIs are used to treat.

### Low Risk & Decreased Effects

* [Benzodiazepines](https://wiki.tripsit.me/wiki/Benzodiazepines)
