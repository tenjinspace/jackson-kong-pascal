**Effects**

Increased focus, abundance of energy, racing thoughts, elevated heartrate.

**Detection**

Blood: 12 hours. Saliva: \~3 days. Urine: 1-4 days. Hair: Up to 90 days.

other stimulants, and depressants. Mixing depressants and stimulants is very rough on the heart. MXE is also to be avoided (possibility of serotonin syndrome).
